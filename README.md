# Books for Founders

## App where startup founders can recommend, search for and rate books that cover various categories, such as:
- Marketing
- Product
- Management
- Sales
- Mission
- and more..

### Users can sign in and search for books by category while also uploading their own recommendation. Once approved, the recommendation will have:
- an Image
- a description of the book
- an overall rating and/or star-rating per category (this still has to be figured out)

## Tech
### Planned to be a full stack web application built with node, express.js and mongodb for storing user and book data.
